###PEHUEN ASSALONE

I’ve been working as a developer since 2011, in the beginning I made IT solutions using C# and SQL while I was studying Systems Engineering at UTN.

In the last 5 years I’ve been working as a Freelance Front-End Developer, doing remote work, providing advise and collaborating in small work teams. This allowed me to meet talented people with whom I shared the greatest experiences.

My goal as a Web Developer is to make solutions that will adapt to every user requirement, with dinamic UI and responsive design. To achive that I apply my knowledge about several technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, LESS and React.

My main interest is to work in a collaborative team that leads to a constant learning, and collective and personal improvement.
